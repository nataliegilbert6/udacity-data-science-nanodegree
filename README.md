# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree - Project 1
# Heart Disease Prediction Analysis

## Installations
 - NumPy
 - Pandas
 - Seaborn
 - Matplotlib

## Project Motivation
For this project I was interested in conducting exploratory data analysis using a [Heart Disease prediction dataset found on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data) containing a sample of 299 heart disease patients to better understand:

- What demographic patterns are associated with heart disease mortality?
- Are any other illnesses associated with heart disease mortality?
- Are there any blood markers that correlate with heart disease mortality that doctors can use to diagnose early?

In addition to exploring the data, I posted my findings via a blog post on Medium, which hopefully provides readers with useful insights into how data can help predict the prognosis of certain diseases.

## File Descriptions

This repo only contains one jupyter notebook (Data Science Nanodegree Project 1.ipynb), which utilizes Python 3

## Medium Blog Post 
The main findings of the code can be found at the Medium Blog post available [here](https://medium.com/@nataliegilbert42/how-data-can-answer-questions-about-heart-disease-risk-factors-6975f46f3d33)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
Acknowledgement should go to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data) and andrewmvd for providing the dataset.
